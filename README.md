# GearGuard — The Ultimate Maintenance Tracker 🛠️

A lightweight Django-based maintenance management system for tracking equipment, work centers, teams, and maintenance requests. It includes a Tailwind-powered UI, admin integration, and a simple dashboard for quick metrics.

---

## ⚡ Features

- Equipment management with categories, serial numbers and statuses (active, under maintenance, scrapped).
- Maintenance requests with types (corrective/preventive), priorities and stages.
- Teams and Work Centers with capacity & cost fields.
- Simple dashboard with key metrics (equipment count, open requests, teams).
- Tailwind CSS-based dark UI (preconfigured build/watch scripts).
- Django admin for quick data administration.

## 🧰 Tech stack

- Python, Django (project includes settings compatible with Django 6.x)
- Tailwind CSS for styling (build via npm)
- PostgreSQL (recommended for production) or SQLite for quick local setup
- Pillow for image handling; psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL

## 🚀 Quick start (development)

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (PowerShell example):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r gearguard/requirements.txt
```

2. Install Node dependencies and build Tailwind CSS (from the `gearguard` folder):

```powershell
cd gearguard
npm install
npm run build:css        # build once
npm run watch:css        # development watch (optional)
cd ..
```

3. Apply migrations and create a superuser:

```powershell
python gearguard/manage.py migrate
# If the management command exists (project references a helper):
python gearguard/manage.py create_initial_superuser
# otherwise use the standard Django command:
python gearguard/manage.py createsuperuser
```

4. Run the development server:

```powershell
python gearguard/manage.py runserver
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to view the app.

> Notes:
> - Default settings use SQLite (`db.sqlite3`). To use PostgreSQL, follow the PostgreSQL steps in `gearguard/README_SETUP.md` and update `gearguard/gearguard/settings.py` DATABASES section.
> - Static files for production should be collected and served by your web server.

## 🧩 Project layout (high level)

- `gearguard/` — Django project & application code
  - `accounts/`, `equipment/`, `maintenance/`, `teams/`, `dashboard/` — core apps
  - `templates/` — project-wide templates (base layout, pages)
  - `static/` — generated Tailwind CSS: `static/css/tailwind.css`
  - `requirements.txt`, `package.json` (Tailwind build scripts)

## 📦 Production notes

- Use PostgreSQL + Gunicorn behind nginx for production.
- Install requirements and run `npm run build:css` before deployment.
- Configure environment variables and update `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and secure settings in `gearguard/gearguard/settings.py` (SECRET_KEY, DEBUG=False, secure cookies).

## 🧪 Tests

Run Django tests with:

```powershell
python gearguard/manage.py test
```

(There are basic test files per app; extend as needed.)

## 🧭 Contributing & workflow

- See `gearguard/COMMIT_STEPS.md` for suggested per-app commit messages and conventions.
- Create issues and PRs for feature requests or bug fixes. Keep changes small and focused.

## ❓ Known notes / TODOs

- The project README and setup notes are split between `README.md` and `gearguard/README_SETUP.md` — refer to the latter for Postgres setup.
- Add a `LICENSE` file if you want an explicit project license.

---

If you'd like, I can also:
- Add a CONTRIBUTING.md or LICENSE file, or
- Add a quick deployment guide for Docker/Gunicorn + nginx.
